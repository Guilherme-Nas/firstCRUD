The project is an beginner CRUD where the website controls the database using forms.

The some folders and documents dont have a meaningful name so ill explain their connection and context here:

Daba is the database folder where all the documents where the POST gets the variables and where query are made, its also where you can find the dbconnect.php where trhe connection to the database is created.

inserir.php = CREATE
leiture.php = READ
updete.php = UPDATE
armagedon.php = DELETE

Website is the folder with the php and html of the website including the index and some forms that send variables using POST.

index.php = INDEX page
registrar.php = CREATE page
lerlista.php = READ page
atualizar.php = UPDATE page
cascade.php = DELETE page
